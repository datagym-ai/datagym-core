Below are a few guidelines we would like you to follow.
If you need help, please reach out to us by opening an issue.

## :lady_beetle: Report a bug
Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute. Before creating a bug report, please check that an [issue](https://github.com/datagym-ai/datagym-core/issues) reporting the same problem does not already exist. If there is such an issue, you may add your information as a comment.

To report a new bug you should open an issue that summarizes the bug and set the label to "bug".

If you want to provide a fix along with your bug report: That is great! In this case please send us a pull request as described in section [Contribute Code](#contribute-code).

## 	:jigsaw: Suggest a feature
To request a new feature you should open an [issue](https://github.com/datagym-ai/datagym-core/issues/new) and summarize the desired functionality and its use case. Set the issue label to "enhancement".

## :package: Contribute code
This is a rough outline of what the workflow for code contributions looks like:
- Check the list of open [issues](https://github.com/datagym-ai/datagym-core/issues). Either assign an existing issue to yourself, or create a new one that you would like work on and discuss your ideas and use cases. It is always best to discuss your plans beforehand, to ensure that your contribution is in line with our goals for DataGym.ai
- Fork the repository on GitHub
- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work. This is usually master
- Make commits of logical units
- Write good commit messages
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository
- Submit a pull request to [datagym-ai/datagym-core](https://github.com/datagym-ai/datagym-core)
